 *   - specific test runs:
 *     ./mf_unit                                    has no flag, and thus runs all its tests.
 *     ./mf_unit --gtest_list_tests
 *     ./mf_unit --gtest_filter=CppTestCase.Vector  tun CppTestCase.Vector only
 *     ./mf_unit --gtest_filter=*                   also runs everything, due to the single match-everything * value.
 *     ./mf_unit --gtest_filter=FooTest.*           runs everything in test case FooTest.
