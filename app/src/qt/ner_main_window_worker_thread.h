 * @brief NER worker thread class.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: remember that QThread subclassing is ANTIPATTERN - QThread is just envelope.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: NEVER allocate heap objects (using new) in the constructor of the QObject
 * class as this allocation is then performed on the main thread and not on the
 * new QThread instance, meaning that the newly created object is then owned by the
 * main thread and not the QThread instance. This will make your code fail to work.
 * Instead, allocate such resources in the main function slot such as process() in
 * this case as when that is called the object will be on the new thread instance
 * and thus it will own the resource.
